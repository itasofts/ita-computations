©Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What does this app do?
   - This app is designed to help you perform various geospatial calculations, including:
     - Computing bearing and distance between coordinates.
     - Calculating area from coordinates and generating area computation sheets.
     - Generating Bearing and Distance sheets.
     - Generating Plan Data sheets with calculated area.
     - Generating Beacon Index sheets.
   - It also supports light and dark modes and provides links to download the app for Android, iOS, and Windows.

2. How do I compute bearing and distance between coordinates?
   - Enter the coordinates for Point 1 and Point 2.
   - Click the "Save and Calculate" button.
   - The app will compute the bearing and distance between the two points and generate a Bearing and Distance sheet.

3. Can I compute area from coordinates?
   - Yes! Enter the coordinates for the boundary points of the area.
   - Click the "Save and Calculate" button.
   - The app will compute the area and generate an Area Computation sheet.

4. What is a Bearing and Distance sheet?
   - A Bearing and Distance sheet displays the calculated bearing (direction) and distance between two points.
   - The app generates two types of Bearing and Distance sheets: one for Point 1 to Point 2 and another for Point 2 to Point 1.

5. What is a Plan Data sheet?
   - A Plan Data sheet includes the bearings and distances along with the calculated area.
   - It is useful for quickly verifying the calculated bearings and distances along with the calculated area without going to check through the bearing and distance from coordinate’s sheet and the area computation sheet.

6. What is a Beacon Index sheet?
   - A Beacon Index sheet lists all the beacons (markers) along with their coordinates.
   - It helps in organizing and referencing beacon data.

7. How do I switch between light and dark mode?
   - Open the menu (three dots in the top-right corner).
   - Select "Toggle Dark Mode" to switch between light and dark themes.

8. How do I download the app for my platform?
   - Open the menu (three dots in the top-right corner).
   - Select "Download Android Version", "Download iOS Version", or "Download Windows Version" to get the app for your device.

9. Can I import coordinates from a CSV file?
   - Yes! Click the "Import CSV (N, E, L)" button to import coordinates from a CSV file.
   - Ensure the CSV file has columns for Northing (N), Easting (E), and Beacon Label (L).
   - Click on the "Save and Calculate" button.
10. How do I clear all entered coordinates?
    - Click the "Clear All Rows" button to remove all entered coordinates and start fresh.

11. How do I save my calculations?
    - After entering the coordinates, click the "Save and Calculate" button.
    - The app will generate the required sheets (Bearing and Distance, Area Computation, Plan Data, or Beacon Index) dynamically.

12. Can I share the generated sheets?
    - Yes! The generated sheets can be saved as PDFs or printed directly from the app.
